<h2 style="margin: 0 0 30px">Purpose and function</h2>

<p>
    The shell is perhaps the most crucial piece of any UI built with
    <a href="www.carbondesignsystem.com"> Carbon</a>. It contains the
    shared navigation framework for the entire design system and ties
    the products in IBM’s portfolio together in a cohesive and elegant
    way. The shell is the home of the topmost navigation, where users
    can quickly and dependably gain their bearings and move between
    pages.
    <br>
    <br>
    The shell was designed with maximum flexibility built in, to serve
    the needs of a broad range of products and users. Adopting the
    shell ensures compliance with IBM design standards, simplifies
    development efforts, and provides great user experiences. All IBM
    products built with Carbon are required to use the shell’s header.
    <br>
    <br>
    To better understand the purpose and function of the UI shell,
    consider the “shell” of MacOS, which contains the Apple menu,
    top-level navigation, and universal, OS-level controls at the top
    of the screen, as well as a universal dock along the bottom or
    side of the screen. The Carbon UI shell is roughly analogous in
    function to these parts of the Mac UI. For example, the app
    switcher portion of the shell can be compared to the dock in
    MacOS.

<h2 style="margin: 30px 0px">Header responsive behavior</h2>

<p>
    As a header scales down to fit smaller screen sizes, headers with
    persistent side nav menus should have the side nav collapse into
    “hamburger” menu. See the example to better understand responsive
    behavior of the header.
</p>

<h2 style="margin: 30px 0px">Secondary navigation</h2>

<p>
    The side-nav contains secondary navigation and fits below the
    header. It can be configured to be either fixed-width or flexible,
    with only one level of nested items allowed. Both links and
    category lists can be used in the side-nav and may be mixed
    together. There are several configurations of the side-nav, but
    only one configuration should be used per product section. If tabs
    are needed on a page when using a side-nav, then the tabs are
    secondary in hierarchy to the side-nav.
